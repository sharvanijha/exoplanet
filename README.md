# exoplanet
finding exoplanets using AI (noting thoughts / responses, right now, will try and implement code later)

questions to address in future:
- since the Kepler space telescope only observed the brightness of these stars for 4 years, does this mean it is only capable of finding exoplanets that have a period of rotation around the star for less than 4 years? if exoplanets that have a period of rotation around the star that are greater than 4 years are out there, is there still a way to detect them if they haven't had to chance to complete their period of rotation or no?
- is revolution or rotation the right term for the previous question?
- do stars' magnetic fields affect the planets which orbit around them?
- how important is dark matter and dark energy in the study of exoplanets, if at all?
